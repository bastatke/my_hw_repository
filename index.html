<h1>Name: Rebecca Astatke</h1>

<p> I am from Colorado and have spent time in a few cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and now Berkeley. I am completing my masters in public health right now and will be pursuing my doctorate next year! I am really interested in data journalism and improving scientific literacy. A big fan of Mona Chalabi, I am taking a free course in Illustrator from Berkeley Art Studio this semester that I hope I can integrate into the final project of this course. I am a newbie to the J-School and am a little nervous but mostly excited for this course!I would be super interested in learning how to integrate the tools like html, javascript and css with R.</p>
